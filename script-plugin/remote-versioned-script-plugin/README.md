# Remote Versioned Script Plugin

This Gradle project shows an example how remote script plugin can be versioned. Client has now the control if he wants
to upgrade to the new version of the script plugin, or he wants to use the existing one in case it contains any breaking changes.

Check the [build.gradle](build.gradle) script file to see how the plugin is applied.

Source code fo the script plugin is deployed in publicly available [Github repository](https://github.com/rivancic/gradle-versioned-script-plugin).
