/**
 * This build script contains two tasks. Main functionality is sorting files by their extension.
 *
 * Tasks are grouped into "files" group.
 *
 * Root folder containing files that have to be sorted is parametrized through Gradle properties with the key [tasks.files.folder].
 * Property has to be accessed through the project.ext map as direct reference doesn't work if property key is named with the dot notation.
 */

/**
 * This method sorts files inside specific directory. It does that in the source directory directly and doesn't use
 * build directory. Files are being sorted based on their extension.
 *
 * Files are being resolved with the Project#file() method, as this way we get correct path to the relative path.
 * Only none hidden files are taken into consideration.
 *
 * For every extension new subdirectory is created and file with that extension is moved to matching subdirectory.
